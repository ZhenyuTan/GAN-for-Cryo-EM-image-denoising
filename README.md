# GAN-for-Cryo-EM-image-denoising
Proof-of-principle studies with conditional generative adversarial networks to denoise Cryo-EM images. This project is the implementation of the Paper "Generative adversarial networks as a tool to recover structural information from cryo-electron microscopy data" on python.
# Network Architecture
Similar to the https://github.com/SpaceML/GalaxyGAN with some modifications.
